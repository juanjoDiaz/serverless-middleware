Serverless plugin to allow middleware handlers configured directly in serverless.yaml

## Requirements:
* Serverless
* AWS provider
* Node.js 8.10+

### Supported runtimes

- [x] nodejs8.10 (both Javascript and Typescript)
- [ ] dotnetcore2.1
- [ ] java8
- [ ] go1.x
- [ ] python2.7
- [ ] python3.7
- [ ] ruby2.5
- [ ] provided 

## Installation

Install via npm in the root of your Serverless service:

```sh
npm install serverless-middleware --save-dev
```

Add the plugin to the `plugins` array in your Serverless `serverless.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-middleware
```

## How it works

Middleware allows you to set up multiple handlers to be executed sequentially including error handlers that will capture any exception in the chain.

Middlewares are just standard AWS lambda handlers that return a promise (or are async).
Handlers using `callback` will NOT work.
```js
const myMiddleware = async (event, context) => { ... };
```

Once `serverless-middleware` is installed you can set the `function.handler` property to an array.
Each middleware handler can be a string (like a standard handler would be) or an object containing the properties `then` and/or `catch`.

For example:

```yaml
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  
functions:
  myFunction:
    handler:
      - auth.authenticate
      - auth.authorize
      - then: myFunction.handler # `then:` is unnecesary here.
      - catch: utils.handlerError
      - # or both can be combined
        then: logger.log
        catch: utils.handlerLoggerError
```

will result in an execution like:

```js
Promise.resolve()
  .then(require('./auth').authenticate)
  .then(require('./auth').authorize)
  .then(require('./myFunction').handler)
  .catch(require('./utils').handlerError)
  .then(require('./logger').log)
  .catch(require('./utils').handlerLoggerError);
```

As with standard promises, catch handlers are only executed when there are exceptions.
The resulting lambda will return the result returned by the last middleware handler executed.

The `event` and `context` objects are passed from handler to handler so you can attach new properties to be accessed by subsequent handlers.
`context` always contains the result of the previous handler in the `prev` property.
The user can also stop at any point in the chain by calling the `end` method in the `context` argument. After `context.end()` is called, no more handlers will be executed.

For example:

```js
const myMiddleware = async (event, context) => {
  if (context.prev === undefined) {
    // Previous middleware handler didn't return. End execution.
    context.end();
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: 'No results',
    };
  }

  ...
};
```

You can also add pre/pos- middleware handler handles at the package level using the `custom.middleware` section of `serverless.yaml`. These middleware are just prepended/appended to all the function middleware handlers chain.

For example:

```yaml

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10

custom:
  middleware:
    pre:
      - auth.authenticate
      - auth.authorize
    pos:
      - catch: utils.handlerError

  
functions:
  myFunction:
    handler:
      - myFunction.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: my-function
          method: get
```

will result in a similar promise chain as above.

## Packaging

In most cases, you shouldn't need to change the default packaging configuration.
For edge cases, Middleware can be configured to use a specific intermediary folder and to not clear it after creating the serverless package.

These settings are also set in the `custom.middleware` section of `serverless.yaml`

```yaml
custom:
  middleware:
    folderName: my_custom_folder  # defaults to '.middleware'
    cleanFolder: false            # defaults to 'true'
```

This might be useful if you are using `sls package` and building your own artifacts.
